# Every lever, and where it lives

**A lever is anything that reduces how much work happens.** This file is the index of them: which home each one sits in, and which file owns its rules. `structure.md`, "Where a lever lives", is the rule that decides the home; this is the map of where the rule has already been applied.

**Three things about every row.**

- **A row is a pointer, never a rule.** There is deliberately no column for what a lever does or how far it reaches — that lives in the owning file
- **A lever missing from this table is a defect in the table. It is never permission.** The owning file decides; a gap here means somebody added a lever without indexing it
- **A row whose file or section no longer exists is reported as a question.** Do not guess where it moved, and do not delete the row. The section titles are written out so a moved section can be found by searching for its title

## The homes

| Home | What it admits |
|---|---|
| **`spec.md`** | a whole-project decision needed before anything is read deeply, and expensive to undo. Its own text — never a declared `Source` |
| **a required section** | this version's whole position. Satisfiable by `spec.md`'s text or by a declared `Source` |
| **an annotation** | one feature or one section, as an exception to that position |
| **`.hora/`** | derivations only. Nothing is ever declared here |
| **the invocation** | one run. Plus that run's own record, which says what it gave up |
| **`request/`** | a page of notes in place of written sections. Drafted from as proposals |

| a declared `Source` satisfying a required role | `spec-format.md`, "Required sections" |
| `Annex` — a listed file that never becomes a feature file | `spec-format.md`, "Annex" |

## What is not a home, and never becomes one

| | Why |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | it explains levers to people, is read by no skill, and comes in `ja`/`en` pairs. **A pointer to this file is the most `docs/` may hold** |
| a hora skill's own prose | a skill executes a lever; it does not own one. Where a skill's file is named above, it is named as the owner of a derivation |
| `specs/skeleton/spec.md` | written to by nobody, and not a version (`structure.md`, invariant 1). A lever pre-declared there would ship with every project that copies it |
| a package skill's mode | no hora file may name one or copy a criterion out of it ("The division of labor", `structure.md`) |
