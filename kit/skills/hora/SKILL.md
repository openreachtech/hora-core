name: hora
description: Implement an application from its spec. Decides where a project stands and runs the five skills that do the work — spec, setup, plan, build, accept — one feature at a time, each to acceptance before the next starts. Runs at the root of the hora repository. Started or restarted only by an explicit `/hora` invocation.
---

# hora

**The orchestrator.** Decide where this project stands, run the skill that comes next, and own every git operation on the way.

`/hora` does no implementation of its own. Five skills do the work:

| Skill | Does | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| **`/hora-spec`** | writes the version's spec, in conversation — stage 0 reads what already exists, then its own seven stages | once per version, until stage 7 passes |
| **`/hora-setup`** | creates the repositories the spec declares, fills in the project's values, reads the real tree | once per version, idempotent |
| **`/hora-plan`** | fixes the version, verifies the spec in conversation, writes the feature list | once per version, re-entered every run |
| **`/hora-build`** | takes one feature through the eighteen checkpoints | **once per feature** |
| **`/hora-accept`** | runs the full unit suites every time, and the acceptance review at the invocation's reach | at each feature's checkpoint 18 (scoped), and once as a whole-version sweep (full) |

**An emergency fix is not one of the five.** `/hora-hotfix` takes one defect to `main` on its own, gives up the acceptance review, and records what it gave up as a debt. `/hora` reports that debt; `/hora-plan` turns it back into work (`../hora-hotfix/SKILL.md`).

Read `references/structure.md` before anything else — the repository layout, where a per-repository command runs, and the three invariants all come from there. `references/commits.md` holds every git rule.

---

## The shape of a run

```
/hora-spec ─> /hora-setup ─> /hora-plan ──┬─> /hora-build #A ─> /hora-accept ─┐
                                          ├─> /hora-build #B ─> /hora-accept ─┤
                                          └─> /hora-build #C ─> /hora-accept ─┴─> sweep ─> merge
```

**One feature goes all the way to acceptance before the next one starts.** Backend, then frontend, then acceptance — per feature, not per layer. Building every backend task, then every frontend task, then testing, means the first time anyone finds out whether a feature *works* is after all of them are written.

**Re-entrancy is the center.** A single session does not run to the end. Each run decides where it is and continues from there. **Nothing is ever redone because a session ended** — every checkpoint's checkbox is written the moment it passes.

**Serial down to the checkpoint.** No feature ever runs alongside another, and no checkpoint alongside another checkpoint.

**Inside a checkpoint, its units do run together.** Five of the eighteen divide into units whose files are exclusive — a table, a module, an operation, a component, a screen — and each gets an implementer of its own. The checkpoint stays one gate with one exit condition (`../hora-build/SKILL.md`, "Step 5 — splitting a checkpoint into units").

---

## Whether hora can start at all

**The procedures `/hora` orders are not in this repository**, and `/hora` never puts them in place itself. They arrive as skills of their own, alongside these, and this is the one thing to confirm before deciding anything else.

```
Is there at least one skill under .claude/skills/ whose name carries an
hoc- / hor- / hof- prefix?
                             if not → stop. Report that the implementation
                                      skills are not equipped, and ask for
                                      them to be equipped before rerunning

Is /hora-setup under .claude/skills/ too?
                             if not → stop. Report that code setup is not
                                      equipped, and ask for it before
                                      rerunning
```

**`/hora-setup` is asked for here because it is not in this package either.** What it does is one stack from beginning to end — which repositories exist, what fills them, what to read once they arrived — so it is written by the boilerplate that knows that stack, and equipped from there. `/hora` orders it like the rest, and a project whose boilerplate has not put it in place cannot get past step 2.

**Nothing here checks the hora skills themselves.** `/hora` is one of them, so a session that reached this line has already proved they are equipped. What cannot be known from the inside is the other package's state, and that is the whole of what this section asks.

**A partial set is not a failure.** Which of them a repository equips is its own decision, and a checkpoint that finds nothing covering its work says so and carries on (`references/structure.md`, "How the match is made"). Only the empty case stops, because there nothing is covered at all.

**How they are equipped is not this file's business.** Say what is missing, not what command to run — the route differs by repository, and naming one of them here would be wrong wherever the other is used.

---

## Deciding where you are

With that settled, do this every time — a fresh start and a restart alike.

```
0. git fetch origin --prune, for the hora repository and every declared row
   that already exists. Then check for a hotfix that landed on main
   (references/commits.md, "Keeping release/<version> current"), and read
   .hora/hotfix/ for any record whose debt: still reads open

1. Does the target version have a spec at all — a specs/<version>/spec.md with
   content in it?                             if not → /hora-spec.
                                              A version with no spec declares no
                                              layout, so /hora-setup has nothing
                                              to read and /hora-plan nothing to
                                              verify

2. Are all declared repositories present, per the current spec's layout?
                                              if any is missing  → /hora-setup

3. Always run /hora-plan. It fixes the version, and reconciles the feature
   list against specs/ on every re-entry

4. Does .hora/questions/<version>/open.md still hold an unresolved
   blocking: yes?                             if so → stop. Report what to fix

5. Does .hora/tasks/<version>/_plan.md still hold an unfinished feature — an
   entry with a [ ] box that the ## Acceptance sweep entry does not already
   close?                                     if so → /hora-build, on the
                                                      first one that is ready

6. No [ ] entry remains that the ## Acceptance sweep entry does not close, and
   _sweep.md's newest block does not read reach: full with a passing verdict
   and a version-criteria: line accounting for every criterion the version
   declared                                   → /hora-accept, whole-version

6a. It does, and entries that sweep closes still stand [ ]
                                              → /hora-plan again, to set them
                                                and their checkpoint 18 off
                                                that block (../hora-plan/
                                                SKILL.md, "collapses to one
                                                sweep")

7. _sweep.md's newest block reads reach: full with a passing verdict and a
   version-criteria: line accounting for every criterion the version
   declared, and every entry in _plan.md is [x]
                                              → merge (references/commits.md,
                                                "Merge order into main";
                                                references/done-criteria.md,
                                                "When a version is done",
                                                conditions 1 and 3)
```

**Step 0 is also what catches `release/<version>` up with a `hotfix/*`.** `/hora` has no scheduler: this fetch and the one right after every merge into `release/<version>` are the only two occasions it gets to notice one landed on `main`.

**An open hotfix debt is reported here, never acted on here.** Step 3's `/hora-plan` is what turns it back into work (`../hora-hotfix/SKILL.md`, "Paying the debt back").

**`/hora` does not ask before running this check, or before acting on an ordinary result.** It stops and asks once the check turns up something it cannot resolve on its own.

**Step 1 is not "write the spec for them".** `/hora-spec` writes nothing without somebody reading it first, and a run that reaches step 1 with nobody there to answer stops there.

**Step 3 runs even when the feature list already exists.** A spec keeps moving while implementation is under way. Only once `/hora-plan`'s reconciliation shows no difference does a version move on.

**Step 5 reads only the entries that carry a checkbox, so a listed feature is never a candidate.** A feature listed under `Baseline: inventoried` sits under `_plan.md`'s `## Not accepted` with no box at all, so it is neither done nor unfinished. **A version whose every remaining feature is listed passes step 5 and is swept at step 6** (`references/spec-format.md`, "`baseline`"). Paying the debt is a later version's ordinary work, scheduled by a person.

**Step 5 also passes over an entry whose checkpoint 18 the `## Acceptance` sweep entry covers.** Its `[ ]` means *the sweep will close this*, not *hand this to `/hora-build`* (`../hora-plan/SKILL.md`, "collapses to one sweep"; `../hora-build/SKILL.md`, "Where to start").

**Steps 6 and 7 read the newest block's own `reach:`, never whether `_sweep.md` exists.** That sweep may be invoked before every feature is done, and every run appends a block, so the file's presence says only that it ran at least once. A sweep invoked at the eighth of twenty gates writes a truthful `reach: scoped`.

**They read `version-criteria:` beside `reach:`, for the same reason one level up.** `reach: full` says the run reached every feature acceptance could reach; the version's own criteria reach no feature's gate at all (`references/spec-format.md`, "15. Version acceptance criteria").

**Keyed that way the two steps leave no gap.** Whatever fails step 7's test — no record, `reach: scoped`, a `failed` verdict, a short `version-criteria:` line — satisfies step 6's predicate, so the run goes back to `/hora-accept`.

**Step 6a exists because the run that earns a collapsed version's checkboxes must also set them.** `/hora-accept` records and never writes `_plan.md`; `/hora-build` never opens those entries, which is the collapse; so `/hora-plan` is the writer, off the sweep's own record. Left to the next invocation's step 3, the merge happens first — and a released version's plan is never rewritten (`../hora-plan/SKILL.md`, "Resolve the diffs first").

**Step 7 tests condition 1 as well, and not condition 3 alone.** A passing sweep says the work was accepted; the checkboxes say the record caught up.

Report the decision in one line before starting work — for example, "continuing 1.0.0. 4 of 11 features done, building #payroll from checkpoint 6".

## What `/hora` owns, and what it never does

**Every git operation happens in the main session** — whether `/hora` runs it directly or a skill it invoked does (`/hora-setup` initializing a row, `/hora-build` cutting a feature branch). **No agent any skill starts ever touches git.**

| | Who does it |
|---|---|
| git, in every repository | **the main session** — `/hora` and the skills it runs. Never an agent |
| writing `.hora/` | the skill whose work it records (`/hora-plan` the plan, `/hora-build` the checkpoints, `/hora-accept` the acceptance records) |
| writing `specs/` | **`/hora-spec`, one approved section at a time, and `/hora-plan`, one approved edit at a time. Nobody else** (`references/structure.md`, invariant 1) |
| writing code and tests | the agents `/hora-build` starts |

**Manual verification is not one of the phases.** A human does it whenever they want, in the backend row, with the commands `/hora-setup` recorded in `.hora/tree/<repository>.md`. What *is* required is the local end-to-end environment checkpoint 17 builds: whenever a run drives a browser, `/hora-accept` stops without it. A gate run that skips the live review is the one run that neither requires the stack nor brings it up, and its record says so (`../hora-accept/SKILL.md`, "What is in scope").

---

## Where the procedures live

**`/hora` holds the order. It holds no procedure and no pass/fail criterion.** How to write a resolver, a migration, a component or a test — and what an acceptance review looks at — all live in the `@openreachtech/hora-skills-ort-*` packages, equipped under this repository's own `.claude/skills/`.

**Never write one of those procedures into a hora skill** (`references/structure.md`, "The division of labor").

---

## The closing report

**The outer `git status` shows nothing from inside the nested repositories.** Run it at the root and only updates to `.hora/` are visible, so commits get forgotten.

**Check and report `git status` for the hora repository and for every declared repository.** The number of repositories differs per project, so walk the declaration.

```bash
git status --short --branch
git -C <project name>-<declared row> status --short --branch    # for every row
```

**`--branch` matters now, not just `--short`.** Every repository is expected to be on `release/<version>`; one sitting on anything else is worth surfacing.

What the report includes:

```
the target version, and which skill the run reached
how many features are done, how many are left, and which checkpoint the
  current one stopped at
every open question — its Q<n> id, its category, its blocking value, one line
  of what it is, and a link to the file it is in (references/structure.md,
  "Citing a question in a report"). Never a bare count
the last acceptance verdict, and what it sent back
every feature this version listed rather than accepted — by id, never a count,
  and with what rests on each one
every open hotfix debt — its <hotfix-id>, the features it touched, and a link
  to its record. Never a bare count
git status for every repository, including the branch (state it explicitly if
  anything is uncommitted, or if a branch is not release/<version>)
what the next run of /hora will start from
```

**Write it in the language of whoever ran it**, always (`references/structure.md`).

**Every question is named and linked, whatever its blocking value** (`references/structure.md`, "Citing a question in a report"). "Two questions remain" is not a report.

When it stopped with a `blocking: yes` outstanding, **put what the human has to do first** — which section to add what to, and the link, at the top.

**Every `eslint-exception` question gets its own line, by name, with its link** — never counted among the ordinary questions.

**Every feature the version listed rather than accepted is named by id too, and never counted.** Name each one, and name what rests on it: a dependent records `Rests on: #x (not accepted)` in its own feature file (`../hora-plan/SKILL.md`, "One file per feature").

**This report is where such a debt is most easily lost.** The verdict and the findings are what everybody reads, and a closing report that ends at "passed" is the sentence somebody remembers a month later (`../hora-accept/SKILL.md`, "Recording the result").

### When a version cannot proceed, lay out the choices

A version with unfinished features blocks the next one from starting. **State the ways out.**

```
1.0.0 has 3 unfinished features. 1.1.0 exists under specs/, but versions run
serially, so it cannot start yet.

Remaining: #payroll #bonus #year-end

  build it        → just run /hora again
  drop it         → mark the section kicked: yes in specs/1.0.0/spec.md
  defer it        → kicked: yes in 1.0.0, kicked: no on the specs/1.1.0/ side
  split it        → cut the release at the last accepted feature: kicked: yes
                    on everything past the cut, the rest handed to the next
                    version through /hora-spec
                    (/hora-spec-horizon, "Splitting a version under way")
```

**A listed feature is never one of the remaining ones, and it is never offered these ways out.** It is running code nobody has specified yet, and the way out is a later version writing its two blocks (`references/spec-format.md`, "`baseline`").

**`/hora` only lays out the choices; it does not decide.**

**When a human asks how to write a spec, run `/hora-spec`.** `specs/1.0.0/spec.md` ships empty, and that skill reads whatever already exists at stage 0, copies the skeleton, asks its way through seven stages, and writes each section once it has been approved.

**On a project that already holds working code, stage 0 is the difference between a spec somebody dictates and one they correct.**

Point them at `references/spec-format.md` and `specs/skeleton/spec.md` when what they want is the format itself, or when they would rather write it by hand (`cp specs/skeleton/spec.md specs/1.0.0/spec.md`). Both routes produce the same document.
