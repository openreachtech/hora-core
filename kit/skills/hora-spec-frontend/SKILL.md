name: hora-spec-frontend
description: Stage 5 of /hora-spec. Design the screens each use case passes through and the operations each screen calls, so nothing on a screen lacks an operation and no operation is unreachable — the empty, failed, waiting and forbidden states included. Invoked by /hora-spec, or directly.

# hora-spec-frontend

**Stage 5 of `/hora-spec`.** Turn the use cases into screens, and connect every screen to the operations stage 4 designed — in both directions.

Read `../hora/references/structure.md` and `../hora-spec/references/principles.md` first. `../hora-spec/references/stages.md` is the authority on this stage's exit condition, and `../hora/references/asking.md` on how anything is put to a person.

**Not applicable when this version declares no frontend repository** — an API-only release for a phone app. Mark the stage `n/a` with that reason, and say which consumer the API is for instead.

## What this stage reads

This is the stage that reads the frontend properly — the pages, the routes, and which operations each screen calls. That mapping goes out as one check per screen group, not per screen.

**What is absent is the finding, and absence is never a check.** The empty, failed, waiting and forbidden states are the ones an existing product most often does not handle, and every one of them is a proposal.

```
"The list screen calls listAttendance and renders its rows."       a check
"The list screen has no empty state. I suggest adding one."        a proposal
```

**Never state the second as though the screen already had it** (`../hora/references/asking.md`). This stage is where the mixing is most tempting: a screen that "should obviously" show something when there is nothing reads, in prose, exactly like one that does.

**A feature listed under `Baseline: inventoried` contributes no screen section and no use-case mapping, and its existing screens are recorded all the same.** It states no use case by declaration, so there is nothing to map it to. But its screens are in the running product, so they are recorded as inherited, the way stage 4 records its tables and operations: one line each, justified by the feature's name in place of a use case. Leave them out and stage 6, which walks every screen this stage wrote, has no line to state a refusal against (`../hora-spec-security/SKILL.md`).

**Nothing is drafted for a listed feature.** Under `Authority: as-built` the running product is legitimate material for a check — a `Calls` table read off the routes, an empty state read off the component. For a listed feature it is not: a drafted screen state for a feature nothing will ever verify reads exactly like a state somebody designed and approved.

**The four states this stage exists to pin down are not asked for it either, and the reason is written rather than left as an omission.** Each goes out as a proposal, a proposal is an invitation to build something, and no run will build this one. The version that pays the debt designs the screens properly, four states and all, and asks then.

---

## What this stage decides

```
which screens exist, and who reaches each one
which screens each use case passes through, in order
which operations each screen calls
what each screen shows when there is nothing, when it is waiting, when it
  failed, and when the person is not allowed
```

## What it must not decide

| | Whose it is |
|---|---|
| a new use case | stage 1 |
| a new operation | **stage 4.** A screen that needs one sends the run back there |
| a table | stage 4 |
| who may open a screen, as a permission | **stage 6.** This stage writes which actor a screen is for; stage 6 writes what happens to everybody else |
| a component, a token, a CSS class, a component file | **`/hora-build`**, at checkpoints 12 to 16 |
| anything about how a screen is built | the package's own frontend skills |

**A screen list is not a design.** What makes this stage worth a gate is the mapping — which use case passes through which screens, and which operations each screen calls. Without it, checkpoint 11 has nothing to verify against.

---

## Unreachable in either direction is a defect

| | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| **a button with no operation behind it** | a screen designed against a backend that does not exist. Either stage 4 is short one operation, or the button should not be there |
| **an operation no screen calls** | either a missing screen, or a feature nobody wants. Ask which |

The acceptance review looks for exactly these two, at the far end of eighteen checkpoints. Finding one here costs a sentence.

**A listed feature sits outside both directions, which are read over what this version specifies.** Its screens are recorded as inherited lines with no `Calls` table, so read as ordinary rows every one of its operations would look unreachable. The running product already connects the two, and neither side restates the connection here (`../hora-spec-backend/SKILL.md`).

---

## The conversation

```
1. Take one use case. Walk it as the person doing it:
     where do they start — a link, an email, an already-open screen?
     what do they see?
     what do they do?
     how do they know it worked?
     where are they left?

2. Name each screen that appeared, and what it is for

3. For each screen, which operations does it call, from stage 4's list?

4. What does this screen show when:
     there is nothing yet
     it is loading
     the call failed
     the person is not allowed to be here
     the data is too large to show at once

5. Repeat for every use case. Then check the operation list for anything no
   screen called
```

**Question 1 is walked as the person, not described as a feature.** "The attendance screen has a list and a button" says nothing about whether anybody can finish anything.

**Question 4 is the one nobody is ever asked, and it is where most of a real screen lives.** Every product has a first run with no data, every call can fail, and every screen someone is not allowed to open gets opened. Propose these; do not wait to be asked.

**Propose the shorter flow.** A use case that takes four screens usually takes two, and the person describing it has been picturing the four for months.

**Frequency decides prominence.** The daily thing goes where a hand already is; the monthly thing does not have to.

---

## Delegates

**This table lists work, not names.** Match each row against the equipped skills' own descriptions when you reach it (`../hora/references/structure.md`, "No hora file ever names one of those skills").

| What is needed |
|---|
| the shared UI/UX project context file the UI generator and the UI auditor both read — app type, users, scope, tokens, accessibility target, project UX rules |
| what a screen has to account for to be correct by construction — states, empties, failures, accessibility, tokens, consent |

**Invoke what you matched; do not summarize it here.** That context file is read again at checkpoints 11 and 18, so this stage is the cheapest place for it to be filled in correctly — the users, the scope and the project's own UX rules are already settled.

If nothing equipped covers a row, say so by the work it names, carry on, and record the gap.

---

## What it writes

**Show each section in full and wait for approval** (`../hora-spec/SKILL.md`).

```markdown
## 13. Screens
<!-- id: screens -->
<!-- target: frontend-employee -->
<!-- depends: api -->

### 13.1 The month's attendance

For: a member of staff. Reached from the top navigation, and after clocking in.

| Calls | Kind | When |
|---|---|---|
| `attendances` | query | on open, and after each change |
| `createAttendance` | mutation | the clock-in button |

- nothing yet — "no records this month", with the clock-in button still available
- loading — the list keeps its height; the button is disabled, not hidden
- failed — the reason, and a way to try again. Never a blank screen
- not allowed — a manager reaching another member of staff's month is told so

### Use cases
<!-- usecases -->

- a member of staff clocks in on arrival, and the day's hours appear in their list

### Acceptance criteria
<!-- acceptance -->

- clocking in twice on one day is refused, and the screen says why
- a month with no records shows the empty state, not an empty table
```

**Write `target` on the section**, naming the frontend repository this screen belongs to. A `target` naming a repository the layout does not declare stops the run.

**The `Calls` table is what makes the mapping checkable.** Checkpoint 11 reads it, the end-to-end test specification derives scenarios from it, and the acceptance review uses it to find the operation nothing reaches.

**An inherited screen is one line, and never a section of its own.** A screen belonging to a listed feature is written in the screens section that targets its repository as a single line — the screen's name, who reaches it, and the feature it belongs to where a use case would be — with no `Calls` table, no state list and neither block.

**Who reaches it is on the line and what it calls is not.** Stage 6 has to state what everybody else sees on that screen, and nothing else in the document names its actor; the `Calls` mapping exists for checkpoint 11, and no checkpoint 11 ever runs for a listed feature. **A screen written out in full here is the stop moved somewhere the stop does not look** (`../hora/references/spec-format.md`, "`baseline`").

---

## Exit condition

Every use case naming its screens in order; every screen naming its operations; nothing unreachable in either direction; every screen's empty, loading, failed and forbidden states written; every `<!-- acceptance -->` block this stage wrote checkable at its own feature's gate, with anything reaching further handed to stage 2 — **every one of those read over the screens this version specifies, a listed feature excepted, which exits with its inherited screens as one line each and nothing else**. `../hora-spec/references/stages.md` is the authority.

---

## When it sends the run back

| Found here | Goes to |
|---|---|
| a screen needs an operation that does not exist | **stage 4** |
| a use case cannot be completed on any screen anybody would build | **stage 1**, to have it restated, or stage 4 |
| the screens the release needs are more than the release can hold | **stage 2** |
