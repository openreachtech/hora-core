name: hora-accept
description: Run acceptance and record what passed and what did not — the full unit suites every time, plus an acceptance review at the reach the invocation calls for. Invoked as checkpoint 18 of /hora-build, as the whole-version sweep, or directly as /hora-accept.

# hora-accept

**Acceptance.** Run the unit suites in full, run the acceptance review at the reach this invocation calls for, and record the result — including what that reach was.

Read `../hora/references/structure.md` first. **This skill is strictly read-only on `specs/`, and it never fixes code.** It finds and records; fixing is a checkpoint's job, in `/hora-build`.

---

## What this skill does not contain

**The content of an acceptance review, and the criteria it passes or fails on, are not in this file and must never be written into it.** They live in the `@openreachtech/hora-skills-ort-*` packages, and this skill delegates the work.

| What is needed | Whose it is |
|---|---|
| whether the environment satisfies the prerequisite, and how to bring it up | the skills covering the local end-to-end container stack |
| **what the review looks at, phase by phase, and what it fails on** | **the skills covering the acceptance review itself** |
| the durable list of scenarios, and how coverage is derived from the API surface | the skills covering end-to-end test specification |
| UX, interaction, accessibility and consent findings, with severity | the skills covering the UI/UX audit |
| the project context those two read (users, scope, tokens, rules) | the skills covering the shared UI/UX project context |
| the kinds of defect a read-only security audit finds, and how it finds them | the skills covering a read-only security audit |
| driving a failing suite to green without weakening it | the skills covering test execution |
| whether a recorded result may stand in for an execution, and what a reused result must be reported with | the skills covering test caching |
| where a backend test lives, and how its run order is guaranteed | the skills covering backend test placement |
| how a unit test for a class is written | the skills covering how a unit test is written |

**What this skill decides is only three things: which features are in scope, in what order the delegates run, and where the result is recorded.**

### No name appears above, and none may

**A skill's name belongs to the package, which is free to change it** (`../hora/references/structure.md`, "No hora file ever names one of those skills"). A renamed skill does not disagree with this file — the name stops matching, and the step is skipped while the record says the run passed.

**So this skill matches at run time, itself**, against the equipped skills' own descriptions, before running the step. **Record the names it picked in the run's own record** — the `Delegate` column below is that record.

**If nothing equipped covers a row**, say so and continue without it. Record the gap by the work that went uncovered. Do not substitute a guess, and do not invent the missing criteria yourself.

---

## What is in scope

**Two invocations, two reaches — and the unit suites are the one thing that never shrinks.**

| Invoked as | Unit suites (step 2) | Review scope (steps 3–6) | Written to |
|---|---|---|---|
| checkpoint 18 of `/hora-build` — the feature gate | every repository, in full | **the feature at the gate.** The live, browser-driven part of the review is **skipped unless explicitly requested, or unless this run is paying a listed feature's deferred acceptance** (below) | `.hora/acceptance/<version>/<feature-id>.md` — **a new block, whatever reach this run took** |
| the whole-version sweep — `_plan.md`'s `## Acceptance` entry | every repository, in full | **every done feature** — for every version in ascending order, every feature whose entry in `_plan.md` is `[x]`, plus the one at the gate if any, plus — in a version the plan collapsed to one adoption sweep — every entry in that version's feature section whatever its box reads (below) | `.hora/acceptance/<version>/_sweep.md` — a new block |

**Step 6 is the one step whose scope is not a feature set.** At the sweep it is pointed at the repository whole; at a gate it does not run, because checkpoint 8 already audited that feature's change set (`../hora-build/references/checkpoints.md`, checkpoint 8).

**"Explicitly requested" means a person asked for it, in the run.** That is the only widening there is, and the run records it with the requester named. Nothing here upgrades a gate run on its own judgment, and nothing downgrades the sweep.

**A widening changes the reach and nothing else — least of all where the record lands.** A gate run asked to reach every done feature is still that feature's acceptance, so it appends a block to that feature's own file and says `reach: full` inside it. **There is no third kind of run and no third path.**

**The version's own acceptance criteria are a third thing in scope, and they are the sweep's alone.** A behavior spanning several features reaches no gate at all (`../hora/references/spec-format.md`, "15. Version acceptance criteria"). `_plan.md`'s `## Acceptance` entry names how many there are and which rest on a feature nobody accepted.

| Invoked as | The version's own criteria |
|---|---|
| checkpoint 18 of `/hora-build` — the feature gate | **not in scope, at any reach** |
| the whole-version sweep | **in scope, all of them** — including the ones earlier versions added, since they stand in the resolved document until somebody removes them |

**A widening does not reach them either.** A widened gate run is still accepting *one feature*, and these criteria are a statement about the version. **Judged at a gate, a criterion spanning three features would fail against a product holding one of them.**

**A standing policy could not live in `_plan.md`, which is why the widening is a person and not a line.** `.hora/` holds derivations, written by skills and read by humans (`../hora/references/structure.md`, invariant 1). **If a project wants "sweep live at every gate" as policy, it belongs in the spec.**

**A feature implemented before Hora Kit was adopted is in scope like any other.** Its checkpoints are marked not-applicable up to the acceptance gate, never through it — so the first sweep after adoption is the run that says what the existing product actually does. Expect findings there.

**A feature the spec only listed is the opposite case, and the derivation has already decided it.** `/hora-plan` writes its entry under `## Not accepted`, with no checkbox at all. **Scope above is read off those checkboxes** — a gate run takes the feature whose gate it is, a sweep takes every entry that is `[x]` — and an entry with no checkbox is neither. **It is therefore out of scope at this version and at every later one, with nothing added here to keep it out.**

**No box at all and an unticked box are two states, and only the first one is this.** `[ ]` says a run is going to close this entry (`../hora-plan/SKILL.md`, "collapses to one sweep"), which is why the row above takes a collapsed version's feature entries into scope whatever their boxes read. **Absence of the box, never its state, is what puts a feature out of scope.**

**That section is taken by what it is, not by an exact heading string: the version's feature section, whatever its heading reads.** A collapsed version's is written `## Features — adopted as built`, so a selector matching a bare `## Features` literally finds no section in precisely the version whose every feature it was supposed to cover. Match the section, then read its entries.

| | `built:` alone | `built:` with `baseline: inventoried` |
|---|---|---|
| Its entry in `_plan.md` | a checkbox, under `## Features` | **under `## Not accepted`, with no checkbox** |
| A gate run | runs, as its checkpoint 18 | **there is no gate** — 18 stays `[ ]` and nothing marks it |
| A sweep | in scope from the run that finished it onward | **never in scope** |
| What a verdict says about it | passed, or a finding routed to a checkpoint | **its id on the `not-accepted:` line, and nothing else** |

**Deriving the exclusion rather than writing a rule for it is the point.** A rule would have to hold at two reaches, three invocation forms and every version after this one, and the first place somebody forgot it would put a feature with no acceptance criteria in front of the review skills — which can only report that nothing failed. The checkbox is absent once, in the plan, and every reach reads the same absence.

**Where the plan collapsed a version into a single adoption sweep**, that sweep is one invocation with every adopted feature in scope, standing in for each one's checkpoint 18. It runs the same six steps as any sweep — only the number of repetitions shrinks. Its findings route to checkpoints per feature, and a feature a finding reopens gets its checkpoints back for real.

**A feature whose acceptance was deferred by a listing runs at full live reach when it is finally accepted, whatever the invocation form.** It is decided mechanically, from two facts together: **no `.hora/acceptance/*/<feature-id>.md` holds a block whose verdict is a pass, in any version, and an earlier version's `_plan.md` names this feature under `## Not accepted`.** Such a run is the only acceptance this code will ever have had, so a live-skipped pass would stand as the whole of what was ever said about it.

**Both facts are needed, and the second is what keeps this from swallowing the gate's own default.** Every feature's checkpoint 18 is its first acceptance, so the missing file alone would widen every gate run ever. A listing is what makes this run different: the deferral was declared, in the spec, and this is the run that pays for it.

**It matters most where the missing record is years old.** The invocation says nothing about the feature never having been accepted, and the person invoking it has no reason to know. **The plan and the absent file are what say so**, identically whether the listing is one version old or four.

**The regression net at a feature gate is the unit suites plus the review's own static checks, and it is cumulative by construction.** The suites run whole repositories, so a feature that breaks an earlier one fails here, in the run that broke it. What a gate run gives up is driving every earlier feature's screens end to end; that is the sweep's job, and the record says which reach its verdict was reached at.

---

## The order to run in

**Each step below states the work, not a name.** Match it against the equipped skills' descriptions first, then run it, and write the names you matched into the record's `Delegate` column.

```
1. Confirm the environment — when the live sweep is going to run
     the skills covering the local end-to-end container stack
     The application must run together with every service behind it, each
     role must be able to sign in, and there must be reviewable data or a
     command that produces it.
     Not satisfied -> stop. Report `lacked-environment` (blocking: yes).
                      Do not review a frontend served on its own, and do not
                      "work around" a missing service
     A gate run whose live sweep is skipped neither requires the stack nor
     brings it up — the review's own capability note then records that
     nothing in its verdict rests on a driven browser. A gate run paying a
     listed feature's deferred acceptance drives, so it needs the stack

2. Unit suites, per repository, from inside it — EVERY run, at EVERY reach
     the skills covering backend test placement and run order, how a unit
     test is written, and driving a failing suite to green
     cd <repository> && <that repository's own test command>
     That command may itself reuse a result recorded for unchanged inputs.
     It is not a weakened suite and not a skipped test — where the equipped
     skills cover test caching, they own when a reuse may stand and what it
     must be reported with, so match them like any other delegate. Where
     nothing covers it, run the command as it is

3. The scenario list
     the skills covering end-to-end test specification
     Reconcile it against the scope: every feature in scope has its
     scenarios, and coverage is derived from the API surface, not remembered
     At a sweep, every one of the version's own acceptance criteria has a
     scenario of its own as well. Each spans several features, so no
     feature's list holds it

4. The acceptance review itself
     the skills covering the acceptance review
     Their own phases, their own criteria, at the reach this invocation set —
     their scoped mode at a feature gate, their full mode at the sweep. Do
     not restate their phases, do not abbreviate the ones that run, and do
     not stop early because the first phases passed
     At a sweep, the version's own acceptance criteria are judged here, one
     by one, and the record says how many held

5. UX findings — at the sweep, or on explicit request; a gate run skips this
     the skills covering the UI/UX audit, against the context the shared
     UI/UX context skills produced

6. Security audit — at the sweep, or on explicit request; a gate run skips it
     the skills covering a read-only security audit
     Checkpoint 8 already ran this per feature, over that feature's change
     set. The sweep points the same audit at the whole repository — what
     differs is the target, not the skill or its checks — to catch what no
     single feature's change could show: accumulated exposure, a dependency
     that decayed, an authorization two features contradict. A gate run
     skips it; checkpoint 8 covered that feature already, scoped. Findings
     route like any other ("What a failure does", below)
```

**Step 1 is a gate for any run that drives the product, not a warm-up.** A live review signs in as each role, completes flows to their success condition, and stops dependencies on purpose to watch what the screen says. None of that means anything against a stub. What a gate run does instead is not a weaker version of the same claim: it keeps the static checks, gives up the driven-browser ones, and its capability note bounds every claim it makes.

**Step 2 comes before the review on purpose.** A unit suite is cheap and its failures are precise.

**Never weaken a test to make step 2 pass.** No test skipped, deleted, loosened or waited out. The skills covering test execution are the authority; it is stated twice because "make the suite green" is exactly the instruction that produces a suite that no longer checks anything.

**A reused result is not a skipped test — and the sweep does not accept one.** A command that recognises its inputs as unchanged skips a second execution, not a suite, so a feature gate may stand on it provided the record says it did. **The whole-version sweep may not**: a version's verdict rests on suites executed for real in that run, so the sweep runs them in whatever mode the skills covering test caching state forces execution. Where nothing equipped covers caching, there is nothing to force and nothing to record.

---

## Recording the result

**The file says what was accepted. A block inside it says what one run found.** The **path** carries the subject; the **block** carries the reach, the scope and the verdict.

| The subject | The path |
|---|---|
| one feature, at its checkpoint 18 — **whatever reach that run took** | `.hora/acceptance/<version>/<feature-id>.md` |
| the version itself, at its `## Acceptance` sweep entry | `.hora/acceptance/<version>/_sweep.md` |

**A widening never moves the file.** A widened gate run still accepts *that feature*. Send it to `_sweep.md` instead and the feature never gets the per-feature evidence the next run reads, and `_sweep.md`'s newest block stops being an attempt to accept the whole version — which is what `/hora`'s steps 6 and 7 read it as.

**Which is also why `_sweep.md` has exactly one writer.**

### One block per run, appended, newest last

**A subject is accepted more than once, and every one of those runs is kept.** A retake after a finding, a sweep re-run, a dependent whose acceptance was cleared and earned again — each appends a block. **Nothing is ever overwritten.**

**Every reader takes the newest block.**

```markdown
# Acceptance — 1.0.0 — #attendance

## Run 1
<!-- reach: full | scoped -->
<!-- scope: attendance (rests on #payroll, not accepted), sign-up, sign-in -->
<!-- live: yes | no (skipped at the gate) -->
<!-- reuse: none | <the steps that reused, and what backed them> -->
<!-- not-accepted: payroll, legacy-import | none -->
<!-- version-criteria: 4 of 4 | not in scope (gate) | none declared -->
<!-- environment: e2e/docker, seeded 2026-08-10 -->
<!-- asked for by: <a person's name, where they widened this run> -->

### Verdict

failed

### What ran

| Step | Delegate | Result |
|---|---|---|
| environment | `<the names you matched>` | ready |
| unit (backend) | `<the names you matched>` | 214 passed (reused; backed as the delegate reported) |
| unit (frontend-employee) | `<the names you matched>` | 51 passed |
| scenarios | `<the names you matched>` | 12 scenarios, 12 covered |
| review | `<the names you matched>` | 2 findings |
| version criteria | — | not in scope (gate) |
| UX | `<the names you matched>` | 1 finding (minor) |
| security | — | not in scope (gate) |

### Findings

1. #attendance — a record saved from the monthly screen is not reachable
   from the daily list. Sends back to: #attendance checkpoint 11.
2. #sign-in — an expired session shows a blank screen instead of saying so.
   Sends back to: #sign-in checkpoint 13.

## Run 2                                    ← the retake. The newest block wins
<!-- reach: scoped -->
<!-- scope: attendance -->
<!-- live: no (skipped at the gate) -->
<!-- not-accepted: payroll, legacy-import -->
<!-- environment: e2e/docker, seeded 2026-08-14 -->

### Verdict

passed over 1 of 20 features; 2 not accepted

### What ran

…
```

**Run 1 stays exactly as it was written.** It is the record that the finding was real, that it was routed, and that the code changed because of it — which is what makes the retake's pass mean anything.

**The `Delegate` column is written with the real names, resolved at run time.** It is a placeholder here because this is a hora file. That column is what makes an acceptance run re-derivable.

**A step that reused a recorded result says so in its `Result`, beside whatever the delegate reported as backing that reuse.** Transcribe what the tool printed — never paraphrase it, and never write counts a reused run did not report. A reuse recorded with nothing beside it is indistinguishable from a step nobody ran, which is the one thing this record exists to rule out.

**Every finding names the checkpoint it sends the run back to, and in which feature.** A finding with no destination is a note; a finding with one is work. The destination may be a different feature than the one at the gate.

**The record is written whether the run passed or failed.** A passing run is the evidence that a gate was cleared; a failing one is why the work that followed it happened. **Which is why the deferred-acceptance test above is a passing block and not the file**: a first gate run that failed creates the file too.

**`version-criteria:` is written on every block, at every reach, and it has three forms and no fourth.** A sweep writes `<checked> of <declared>`; a gate run writes `not in scope (gate)`; a version whose spec declared `none` writes `none declared`. A block with no line at all is indistinguishable from a sweep that never looked.

**A sweep whose `<checked>` is short of `<declared>` has not passed.** One criterion left unchecked is recorded by name, and the run reported as partial.

**The record names its own reach and its own gaps — `reach`, `live` and `not-accepted` are not optional lines.** A scoped, live-skipped pass over eight features and a full sweep over eleven read alike otherwise. **`not-accepted:` is written `none` where there is nothing**, because a line left out is indistinguishable from a run in which nobody considered it.

**`not-accepted:` lists every feature in the version nobody accepted, not only the ones this run's scope touched.**

**It is read off `_plan.md`'s `## Not accepted`, and out of nothing else — the section of the version being recorded, at both reaches, and no other version's.** That section is complete by construction: a listing carries forward until some version writes `<!-- baseline: verified -->`, and `/hora-plan` re-derives the section on every run. It is the one place where "nobody accepted this" is written down rather than remembered by whoever invoked the run.

**The union over every version is refused, and a sweep reads no released version's section.** A `[x]` in 1.0.0 records work that really happened, but a frozen `## Not accepted` records **what that version's tag claimed**, and no released `_plan.md` is ever rewritten. So 1.0.0 names `#billing` forever, including after 1.1.0 pays the debt — **a feature this version's section does not repeat is one whose debt this version paid.**

**A dependent's id in the `scope` line carries what it rests on.** A feature may depend on one the spec only listed, and its own pass then rests on behavior nobody ever stated. **A pass resting on unstated behavior is allowed to exist; a pass that hides what it rests on is not.** When the debt is later paid, that dependent's checkpoint 18 is cleared and its acceptance earned again — and **that re-run is not a first acceptance**: its record already holds a passing block.

**The bare `passed` is earned by two lines together — `not-accepted: none` and `reach: full` — and everything else takes the counted form.** There are two ways for "this version is accepted" to be false: a feature the spec listed that nobody accepted, or a run that stopped short of the features it could have covered.

```
passed                                             ← only where not-accepted: none AND reach: full
passed over 17 of 20 features; 3 not accepted      ← reach: full, three features listed
passed over 8 of 20 features; 0 not accepted       ← reach: scoped — a full run asked for mid-version
passed over 1 of 20 features; 0 not accepted       ← reach: scoped — a feature gate
failed
```

**The reach half is what stops a run that covered part of a version from reading as a whole-version pass.** A widened gate run mid-version has eight features in scope, `reach: scoped`, `not-accepted: none` — under a grammar keyed on the listing alone it would write a bare `passed`. **Two separate things stop that**: the path keeps it out of `_sweep.md`, and `../hora/references/done-criteria.md` reads `reach:` beside the verdict.

**The counts are over the version's whole feature list, whatever this run's scope was:** `<n>` is what this run covered, `<m>` every feature the version's spec carries, `<k>` the length of the `not-accepted:` line.

**`<m>` counts the listed features too.** Seventeen specified and three listed is `17 of 20` — never `17 of 17`, which reads as a run that covered everything there was to cover. **`/hora-plan`'s own closing report counts the other way, on purpose**: a plan of twenty with three listed is seventeen to build (`../hora-plan/SKILL.md`, "When this skill finishes"). **The two are not the same number, and neither is wrong.**

**A sweep that covered less than it could have writes `reach: scoped`, never `full`.** `full` is a claim about what was covered, not about what was invoked: it says the run reached every entry `_plan.md` gives a checkbox to, for every version in ascending order.

**A listed feature is not what makes a run scoped, and it may not be**, because no run can reach one. Read the other way, a version holding a single listed feature could never record a full reach and so could never be done. **`reach:` says how much of what was reachable this run reached; `not-accepted:` says what nothing reached.**

**The verdict word is where this is enforced, and the header three lines above it is no substitute.** The verdict is what every downstream reader consumes, so the reduction is written into the word that actually gets read.

---

## What a failure does

**This skill never fixes anything.** It reports, and `/hora-build` acts.

| Kind of finding | What happens |
|---|---|
| the implementation falls short | the named checkpoints are cleared in the named features, and rebuilt through a `retake/` branch (`../hora/references/commits.md`) — the `feature/` branch has already merged by this point |
| the implementation falls short, **in a feature marked `built before Hora Kit was adopted`** | the same, and **the not-applicable marks it lands on are cleared too.** Code that has to change was not simply inherited |
| the spec cannot be satisfied under any reading | a `contradiction` question (`blocking: yes`), and the spec is changed through **`/hora-spec`**, at the stage `../hora-spec/references/stages.md` names |
| an ambiguous criterion was met under one reading | a `spec-assumption` question (`blocking: no`), naming the reading assumed |
| the environment was not there | a `lacked-environment` question (`blocking: yes`). **No code change is attempted** |
| **a version acceptance criterion did not hold** | the named checkpoints are cleared in the features its `spans:` names — **the earliest one where a finding could land in more than one** — and rebuilt through a `retake/` branch |
| **a version criterion failed in the part it `rests on:`** — the behavior of a feature the spec only listed | **there is no checkpoint to clear**, so the finding names the debt: pay it in this version, or change the criterion through `/hora-spec`. **Both readings recorded, neither recommended**, as a `contradiction` question (`blocking: yes`) |
| a real finding the project decides to live with | an `acceptance-finding` question, recording the decision and who made it |
| **a finding in a conflict-proof file or in a dependency**, which no feature's checkpoint owns | its own `update/` branch (`../hora/references/commits.md`) — planned growth of something shared, not a redo of a feature. **The run records which branch it named** |

**Two rows name a destination that is not a checkpoint, and both have to.** The rested-on row, because a listed feature has none — re-scheduling the feature to make one would hand code already serving users to `/hora-build` from checkpoint 1. The shared-code row, because a conflict-proof file and a dependency belong to every feature and to none, so clearing one feature's checkpoint would name the wrong owner.

**Which of the two readings holds cannot be settled here.** Either the inherited code does not do what the criterion claimed, or the criterion claimed something about inherited behavior nobody ever stated. **That is the price of the criterion having been allowed to rest on unstated behavior.**

**A tool that reports its own result as untrustworthy is not a test failure.** It is a defect of the measuring instrument, so the run stops and reports it as blocking (`unreliable-measurement`), and the record says no verdict was reached. Do not re-run it until it agrees, and do not record a pass on the strength of what it reported before it said so.

**A finding is never resolved by deciding it is acceptable inside this skill.** That decision belongs to a person, and it goes into the question file with their name on it.

**Every question this run raised is reported by name, with a link to the file** (`../hora/references/structure.md`, "Citing a question in a report"). **Never a count.**

---

## Four things that are always checked, whatever the delegates find

These are properties of *this run* rather than of the product, so no delegate owns them.

- **Was every feature in the version actually exercised — the version's whole feature list, not this run's scope?** Checking against scope can only ever answer yes. Say which features were not reached and why — out of scope at this reach, listed and never accepted, or in scope and missed. **For every feature this run did not drive, name in the record the last version in which it was driven**, read out of `.hora/acceptance/` as the newest block, in any record there, whose `live:` reads yes and whose `scope:` names that feature. A file's mere existence dates nothing. `never` is an answer, and it is the one worth reading
- **Did any step get skipped because a delegate was missing?** Record the gap by name. A run with a step missing is a partial run, not a pass with a footnote
- **Does `version-criteria:` account for every criterion the resolved document holds?** The denominator is read off the spec's `Version acceptance criteria` section, and `_plan.md`'s `## Acceptance` entry is what it is checked against — two derivations of one source, so a disagreement means one was not re-derived. At a sweep, name every criterion that went unchecked and why. **`not in scope (gate)` is a complete answer for a gate run and never for a sweep**
- **Does the `not-accepted:` line say what `_plan.md`'s `## Not accepted` says?** It is checked against the source it was copied from and against nothing else — **the section of the version being recorded, never a released version's frozen one**. **A disagreement fails the run.** Name both readings and leave the reconciling to `/hora-plan`

**The first is checked against the whole list because the sweep was the only backstop for code no spec mentions.** A sweep that drove every feature also walked over the hand edits and the hotfixes nothing in `specs/` describes. Reading scope off checkboxes takes the listed features out of that net, and putting the net back is not this skill's to do — a run cannot review a feature that has no criteria. **What it can do is leave the hole visible and dated**: eleven features, eight driven here, two last driven in 1.2.0, one never.

**The last two are copies checked against their sources, and that is the most a run can check here.** Whether the plan itself matches the spec is stage 7's (`../hora-spec-review/SKILL.md`, "Run the mechanical pass first"). What this run can catch is the drift it introduces itself.
