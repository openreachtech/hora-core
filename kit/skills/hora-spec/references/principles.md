# The thinking a spec is written with

**What every stage of `/hora-spec` applies while it talks to somebody.** `stages.md` says what must be true before a stage is over; this says what to weigh on the way there.

---

## The boundary this file sits on

Hora Kit holds no procedure and no pass/fail criterion that `@openreachtech/hora-skills` already holds (`../../hora/references/structure.md`, "The division of labor"). The line runs like this:

| | Owns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **here** | **the question to ask, and what to weigh in answering it** — at the stage where no code exists yet | *"does this write have to have finished by the time the person sees a response?"* |
| **the package's skills** | **how the answer is built, and what counts as done properly** | *where a background job's classes live, how they are wired to the resolver, and when one gets a queue of its own* |

**The test: if a line here could be checked against the package and found to disagree, it does not belong here.** Nothing below states a column type, a naming rule, a directory, a nullability convention or a retry policy.

**Where a stage needs one of those rules in order to ask a sensible question, it invokes the skill and reads it.**

---

## 1. Everything starts from a use case

**Who, doing what, to get what done — and through what kind of interface.** Until that is fixed, a data model has nothing to hold, an operation has nobody calling it, and a screen has no reason to exist.

**Break down what was asked. Do not transcribe it.** A request arrives as a feature list, because that is how the person has been thinking about it. Turning "attendance management, approval, payroll" into the six things somebody actually completes is the work of stage 1.

**Propose. A stage that only asks is doing half the job.** The gaps in a request are invisible from the inside of it — the case nobody thought of, the flow that is two screens longer than it needs to be, the role that turns out to be two roles.

**Never let a proposal in silently** (`../SKILL.md`, "The line this skill must not cross").

---

## 2. A release carrying too much is the normal failure

**Not a risk to watch for — the default outcome, unless somebody actively narrows it.**

**So narrow it, out loud, at stage 2.** The question that does the work is not "is this important?" — everything is important — but **"which use case is impossible without it?"**

**The goal of a spec is not coverage. It is the fewest use cases somebody actually needs, served in the best form available.** Ten features half-served is worse than four served well, and slower, because the four carry the ten's design compromises.

**Say when a release is overloaded even after being told it is fine.** State it once, propose the split, and if the answer is still no, record it (`scope`) and carry on. **The decision belongs to whoever asked for the product; saying nothing does not.**

---

## 3. Build for now. Design for what was named

**Implement only what this release needs. That is not permission to make the next release impossible.**

| The spec says | What the design does |
|---|---|
| out of scope **for now** (to be built later) | leave a seam. Keep the thing behind it replaceable |
| **permanently** out of scope | do not abstract it. Exclude it from the design entirely |

**Read the first as the second and the structure cannot take it later; read the second as the first and an abstraction layer gets built that nobody uses.**

**Also name what nobody has planned but somebody can see coming.** A notification channel that is email today, a search that is a `LIKE` today and a search platform later, a single tenant that becomes several. None of it is built now; all of it is a sentence in the "for now" list with what unblocks it. **A foreseen requirement with no seam named is a wish, not a design constraint.**

---

## 4. The boilerplates' own API style is the default. Another is a choice with a reason

**The stack handbook names the API style the boilerplates are built around** (`docs/stack/middleware.md`), so a spec that says nothing has said that.

**Another style is available, and choosing it needs a stated reason.** The reasons that count are the handbook's too — a consumer that already exists and already speaks it, a third party that cannot speak the default, a transfer the default is a poor fit for, a public surface whose fixed URL shape is part of the contract.

**Several styles may exist in one backend, per server, and the server table is where that is declared.** What belongs to the spec is which servers exist, who consumes each, and why.

---

## 5. Roles on one endpoint, or endpoints of their own

**The most consequential choice stage 4 makes, and the one most often made by accident.** Ask who the users actually are before asking how permissions work.

| The situation | What to do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **roles come and go** — a new one per client, per plan, per team | **one endpoint, switched on role** | every added role is a row of configuration, not a new server, a new schema and a new auth filter |
| **genuinely different entities** — an administrator is not a member of staff: a different table, a different login, a different lifecycle | **separate endpoints, separate authentication** | one identity model that has to be two is where privilege escalation gets built by accident |
| one identity model, but **security requirements are unusually high**, or **permissions are unmanageably tangled** | separate endpoints per role, so that which operations exist differs by endpoint | the middleware gets simpler and a missed check becomes a missing endpoint rather than a silent hole. **Not the default** — it multiplies the schema and every operation added afterwards |

**Say which one, and why, in the spec** (stage 6's exit condition). The next version's new role is decided against that reason or against nothing.

**How an endpoint is wired, what its auth filter is, and how a public operation is allowed through all belong to the package's skills.** What belongs here is how many endpoints there are and who each one is for.

## 6. Scale is a number, or it is nothing

**Ask for four numbers, at stage 3.**

```
users at launch
users foreseen, and by when
the heaviest single operation, and how much it touches
how long data is kept, and what happens to it after
```

**A number changes the design; an adjective does not.** Whether a total is stored or recalculated, whether a list is paginated from the first day, whether a report is a query or a job — each has a different answer at two hundred records and at two million, and no answer at all at "a lot".

**The heaviest single operation gets a seam of its own.** Keeping that one thing separable — its own job, its own queue, its own server later — costs a sentence now. Scaling everything because one thing is heavy is the alternative.

**Where nobody knows the number, write what was assumed, and record it** (`spec-assumption`).

---

## 7. Synchronous if it finishes now. A job if it might not

**Ask one question of every write: does it have to have finished before the person sees a response?**

| Answer | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| yes, and it finishes in the request | an operation — a mutation, or a REST renderer |
| yes for the caller, no for the side effect (a mail, an audit line, a cache) | a post-worker: the response goes first, the side effect follows |
| no — it is long, it is retried, it is scheduled, it depends on something slow | a background job |

**A job that must be able to scale alone gets its own queue.** That decision is made here, at the spec, not discovered later.

**The package owns all three: the decision's implementation, the job itself, and the side effect after a response.** What belongs to the spec is which processing is which, and why — recorded in the `Background jobs` table.

**An external call is the case worth naming explicitly.** Anything that leaves the process can be slow or down, and putting it in the request path makes somebody else's outage your error page.

---

## 8. Authorization is the thing left unsaid

**Ask it of every operation and every screen, without exception**: who may call this, and what happens when somebody else does.

**Ask it of the data too.** Which fields are personal, which are regulated, who may read them, and what a log file is allowed to contain.

**An unstated caller is an operation that will be implemented with whatever filter its neighbours had.** That is what makes this the one gate in this document with no "not applicable" case.

**The package's audit skills own what kinds of defect exist, and they audit code, not documents.** What belongs to the spec is the stated caller, the stated failure behavior, and the named sensitive field.
